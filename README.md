# Statamic Starter Kit
A base starter for Statamic with my preferred config and boilerplate.

## Installation
Starting a new project (with the [Statamic CLI](https://github.com/statamic/cli)):
```
statamic new my-app alexthekiwi/statamic-starter
```

Or install into an existing project:
```
php please starter-kit:install alexthekiwi/statamic-starter
```

## Development
Compile front-end dependencies:
```
npm run dev
```
